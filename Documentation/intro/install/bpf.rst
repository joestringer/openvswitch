      Convention for heading levels in Open vSwitch documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

======================
Open vSwitch with BPF
======================

This document describes how to build and install Open vSwitch using an BPF
datapath.

.. warning::
  The BPF support of Open vSwitch is considered 'experimental'.

Build requirements
------------------

In addition to the requirements described in :doc:`general`, building Open
vSwitch with DPDK will require the following:

- LLVM 3.7.1 or later

- Clang 3.7.1 or later

- iproute-dev 4.6 or later

- Linux kernel 4.10 or later

  The following Kconfig options must be enabled to run the BPF datapath:

``_CONFIG_BPF=y``
``_CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL=y``
``_CONFIG_NET_CLS_BPF=m``
``_CONFIG_NET_ACT_BPF=m``

  The following optional Kconfig options are also recommended:

``_CONFIG_BPF_JIT=y``
``_CONFIG_HAVE_BPF_JIT=y``

- Linux-tools from a recent Linux kernel

Installing
----------

OVS can be installed using different methods. For OVS to use BPF datapath, it
has to be configured with BPF support (``--with-bpf``).

#. Clone a recent version of Linux net-next tree::

   $ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net-next.git

#. Go into the Linux source directory and build libbpf in the tools directory::

    $ cd linux/
    $ make -C tools/lib/bpf/

#. Ensure the standard OVS requirements, described in
   :ref:`general-build-reqs`, are installed

#. Bootstrap, if required, as described in :ref:`general-bootstrapping`

#. Configure the package using the ``--with-bpf`` flag::

       $ ./configure --with-bpf=$LINUX_TOOLS

   where ``LINUX_TOOLS`` is the path to the Linux tools/ directory that was
   compiled in step 2.

   .. note::
     While ``--with-bpf`` is required, you can pass any other configuration
     option described in :ref:`general-configuring`.

#. Build and install OVS, as described in :ref:`general-building`

Additional information can be found in :doc:`general`.

Setup
-----

Before running OVS, you must ensure that the BPF filesystem is available::

    # mount -t bpf none /sys/fs/bpf
    # mkdir -p /sys/fs/bpf/ovs

   .. note::
     We should get rid of this requirement on users, and just robustly ensure
     that the filesystem is available and prepared correctly (or do so if it
     is not).

   .. note::
     Depending on how OVS was installed, the BPF datapath binary may or may
     not be available. Check the logs when running OVS, if it complains about
     not finding bpf/datapath.o, look for this file in your OVS build tree and
     copy/symlink it across. Probably it's supposed to live in
     /usr/share/openvswitch/bpf/datapath.o.

Open vSwitch should be started as described in :doc:`general`.

If the linux-tools package is not installed with libbpf.so, then ensure
that this library is available via your library path::

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LINUX_TOOLS}/lib/bpf:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

When adding a bridge to Open vSwitch, specify the datapath type as bpf::

    $ ovs-vsctl add-br br0 -- set bridge br0 datapath_type=bpf

To validate that the bridge has successfully instantiated, you can use the
ovs-bpfctl utility::

    # ovs-bpfctl show

Limitations
------------

- The BPF datapath is a work in progress and has a limited set of support
  for matching and actions.

Bug Reporting
-------------

Please report problems to bugs@openvswitch.org.
